Kaprekar's-Constant

A short Python program highlighting Kaprekar's Constant (6174)
The speciality of this number is that when you take a random 4 digit number constituting 
atleast 2 distinct digits with each repeating a maximum of 2 times, the difference of the
arrangement of the digits of the number in descending order and in ascending order eventually converges to 6174
